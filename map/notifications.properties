GameSetup=<body><p><b> Welcome to Feudal Japan </b><br/>A Shogun map for Triplea, created by Rolf Larsson.<br /></p></b><br/><br/><p><b> The following Boni can be given to each Clan controlled by an ai by purchasing them in the next step<br/> and place them in the territory with the AI Bonus decoration in the upper left corner of the map:</b><br/><br/><br/><b>Alliance Bonus</b><br>Ai controlled clans are allied at start.<br/><br/><b>Ashigaru Bonus</b><br>Ai controlled clans get 1 Ashigaru for free per turn and another one with a chance of 20%.<br/><br/><b>Betrayer Bonus</b><br>Ai controlled clans can go to war directly with a human player from an alliance relation, without a warning.<br/><br/><b>Castle Bonus</b><br>Ai controlled clans get a castle for free with a  chance of 20% per turn.<br/><br/><b>Daimyo Bonus</b><br>Ai controlled clans get back 1 Daimyo immediately when all are lost and has a  chance of 25% to get another one back.<br/><br/><br/>Recommended:<br/>All unit boni are a good way to start with a little challenge. Alliance and Betrayer boni are a good combination too,<br/> but after some rounds the alliances will change anyway.<br/> Combinations with default options (income, attack-defense-boni) are another way to make the ai more challenging.<br/>Try some of them to find your own good difficulty setting. <br /><br/><br/><p><b> Choose Human Players by purchasing their markers in the next step<br/> and place them in the territory with the Human Players decoration in the upper left corner of the map.</b><br/><br/></body>
